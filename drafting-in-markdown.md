# Introduction
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely supported.  While Markdown is significantly easier to use than XML it is also less powerful and is less standardised.  Consequently the Markdown toolchains are very popular but the tools are not interchangeable as they use different syntaxes.

## Quick start guide

1.  Choose a Markdown toolchain from the list below
1.  The chosen toolchain will normally include its own template, but you may also find templates at [Templates and schemas](/templates-and-schemas#markdown), which you then edit with your choice of text editor.
1. If you require automated builds then consider the [Github workflow](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/TEMPLATE.md).
1. Process your edited I-D using the [IETF Author Tools web service](https://author-tools.ietf.org).

# Markdown toolchains
The following Markdown toolchains have been reported in common use by I-D authors.

## kramdown-rfc
[kramdown-rfc](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc/wiki) is an open source text processor that converts files written in its proprietary markdown syntax into RFCXML. This is by far the most commonly used Markdown toolchain for I-Ds.

The [Author Tools](https://author-tools.ietf.org) web service supports kramdown-rfc as one of its backend processors.

## mmark
[mmark](https://mmark.miek.nl) is an open source text processor that converts files written in its proprietary markdown syntax into RFCXML.

The [Author Tools](https://author-tools.ietf.org) web service supports mmark as one of its backend processors.

## internet-draft-template and i-d-template
[internet-draft-template](https://github.com/martinthomson/internet-draft-template) and [i-d-template](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template) are a pair of tools that work together together to provide an automated Markdown I-D build system in GitHub.  Behind the scenes, they use [kramdown-rfc](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc) as the Markdown processor but can be configured to use [mmark](https://mmark.miek.nl) or even an RFCXML processor.

To use these tools you start by [creating a new repository](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/TEMPLATE.md) using [internet-draft-template](https://github.com/martinthomson/internet-draft-template/generate).  The new created repository includes a template Markdown file and the [automation features](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/FEATURES.md#automation-features) of i-d-template.

# Supporting tools
Authors writing in Markdown may find the following tools helpful:

## bibxml2md
[bibxml2md](https://github.com/yaronf/bibxml2md) converts BibXML references into Markdown.  See [References in RFCXML](/references-in-rfcxml) for more details.

## draftr
[draftr](https://github.com/bifurcation/draftr-js.github.io) provides a [live on-screen](https://draftr-js.github.io/) rendering using kramdown-rfc.  This tool is no longer maintained, see kdwatch below instead.

## kdwatch
[kdwatch](https://github.com/cabo/kdwatch) is a locally installable live-update rendering display.

## vscode-livepreview
[vscode-livepreview](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-livepreview) is a VS Code extension from Microsoft that can preview the HTML document rendering. It does this by hosting a local HTTP server that can be accessed via the internal VS Code browser or an external browser. Can be combined with any "build
on save" approach for a more live-update type workflow.
